# cef-boilerplate

This repository is a template for creating CEF screens using React with TypeScript for a RageMP server.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and use the repository:

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (version 18.x or later)
- npm (version 6.x or later)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cef-boilerplate.git
   ```
2. **Navigate into the project directory**

   ```bash
    cd cef-boilerplate
   ```
3. **Install the dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Development
To start the development server, run:
```bash
npm start
```

This will start a development server at http://localhost:3000 where you can see your changes live.

### Building for Production
To create a production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a build folder containing the optimized production build of your React application.

## Using in RageMP
After building your project, follow these steps to use it in your RageMP server:

1. **Copy the build folder**

    Copy the contents of the build folder to your RageMP server's `client_packages` directory.

2. **Reference the CEF screens in your RageMP scripts**

   Ensure that your RageMP server scripts correctly reference the CEF screens you've built. This will typically involve specifying the HTML files within your client-side scripts.

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Source files for your React application.
- `public/`: Public assets that will be copied to the `build` folder.
- `build/`: The production build of your React application (generated by `npm run build`).
